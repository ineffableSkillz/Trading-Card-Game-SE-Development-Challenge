# Trading Card Game SE Development Challenge

## What's this repo all about?
This repository will hold the code for my Trading Card Market game which will consist of a central cerver and many clients connecting and trading cards.

The challenge is to create **everything** (including planning) within 24hours, whilst implementing as many good Software Engineering practices, structures (and so on) as possible~
